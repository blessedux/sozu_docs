# How It Works

Sozu Capital's decentralized credit system transforms donations into empowerment through a transparent, trust-based financial ecosystem.

## Overview

Donors fund micro-credit batches. Funds flow into on-chain Sozu Vaults generating DeFi yield (10-15% APY). Yield supports trust-based credit lines for verified entrepreneurs. Every transaction visible through TRUFA Proof of Allocation.
